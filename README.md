# passwordGenerator

This application generates a random password depending on user entered criteria.

They must select a character count for their password with an included slider bar that 
limits the range from 8 - 128.

The user must also select between 1 and 4 character sets by clicking at least 1 out of a series
of 4 checkboxes which are each labeled with their corresponding character sets.

Finally, when the user clicks the button Generate Password, a random password fitting the selected criteria
will be displayed in the text box above.  The user may copy the password to their clipboard to reuse it.
